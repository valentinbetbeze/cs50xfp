## Project summary
Development of a simple bash-like command-line interface in C. The purpose of this project is twofold: improving my C programming skills and learning how a CLI works under the hood. In the continuity of this project, any student is welcome to copy and modify this project as he/she sees fit.


## User needs
<ol type="A">
    <li>The user shall be able to know where he/she is within the directory structure.</li>
    <li>The user shall be able to 'travel' through the directory structure of his/her system.</li>
    <li>The user shall be able to modify the directory structure of his/her system.</li>
    <li>The user shall be able to write and use C programs.</li>
</ol>


## Specs
<ul>
    <li>A1. Print the current location of the user within the directory structure.</li>
    <li>A2. Print the content of a directory structure, from the current folder.</li>
    <br>
    <li>B1. Move forward in the directory structure.</li>
    <li>B2. Move backward in the directory structure.</li>
    <li>B3. Move to a specific location in the directory structure.</li>
    <br>
    <li>C1. Create a directory structure element (folder or file).</li>
    <li>C2. Delete a directory structure element (folder or file).</li>
    <li>C3. Rename a directory structure element (folder or file).</li>
    <li>C4. Move a directory structure element (folder or file) to a specific location.</li>
    <br>
    <li>D1. Compile a .c file.</li>
    <li>D2. Run a .o file.</li>
</ul>

## Other requirements
* Thoroughly comment the code using Doxygen formatting.
* Write a DESIGN.md to explain design choices.
* Write a README.md file for this program. Explain how to compile, configure and use the program. Include a FAQ.
* Make a 2-minute video presenting the project.


## Milestones:
* Milestone 0 - Creation of the project, scope and specs defined: **13/03/2023**
* Milestone 1 - The CLI program can run and shut down reliably, accepts inputs from the user and parses the input: **15/03/2023**
* Milestone 2 - The CLI program can operate system calls: **16/03/2023**
* Milestone 3 - The CLI program allows the user to run a C program: **18/03/2023**
* End date - All specifications are verified, all user needs are validated, all documentation is written: **19/03/2023**


## Steps
1. ~~Create a function to read a user input from the command line and parse it. Return the elements of the command.~~
2. ~~Test, commit and push.~~
3. ~~Create the interface for the CLI. First within bash itself, later on in a separate window. Issue a statement at the launch of the interface to tell how to exit it. If necessary, create the function to exit the interface. Include error handling.~~
4. ~~Test, commit and push.~~
5. ~~Complete user need A. Learning how to interact with the operating system will be mandatory (system calls).~~
6. ~~Test functions A1 and A2. Commit and push.~~
7. ~~Complete user need B.~~
8. ~~Test functions B1 to B3. Commit and push.~~
9. ~~Complete user need C.~~
10. ~~Test functions C1 to C4. Commit and push.~~
11. Learn about how to compile a .c file. Learn about GCC and Makefiles.
12. Complete user need D.
13. Test functions D1 to D2. Commit and push.
14. Validate user needs A, B, C and D.
15. Review the code one last time and comment thoroughly. Make sure Doxygen formatting is applied.
16. Write README.me.
17. Complete DESIGN.md with a conclusion to the project.


## Design choices

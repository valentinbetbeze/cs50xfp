## Project summary
Development of a simple bash-like command-line interface in C. The purpose of this project is twofold: improving my C programming skills and learning how a CLI works under the hood. In the continuity of this project, any student is welcome to copy and modify this project as he/she sees fit.


## User needs
<ol type="A">
    <li>The user shall be able to know where he/she is within the directory structure.</li>
    <li>The user shall be able to 'travel' through the directory structure of his/her system.</li>
    <li>The user shall be able to modify the directory structure of his/her system.</li>
    <li>The user shall be able to write and use C programs.</li>
</ol>
